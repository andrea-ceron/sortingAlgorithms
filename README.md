# sortingAlgorithms
sorting Algorithms written in C++

# Insertion Sort
Big O(n^2)
Omega (1)

Complexity of the insertion Sort Algorithm varies from an Omega(1) [Omega of 1], if the algorithm is run in the best case (array is already ordered), to a Big O(n^2) [Big O of n squared] which represents the complexity in the worst scenario (array is ordered in the opposite way).

N is a variable that represents the length of the array.
